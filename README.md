# Sherlock  
A simple script which holds a duty to scan and extract a particular string(s) from the given text file, check for its validity and print related info.  

"Sherlock" was a bonus + fun task provided to me during the start of an externship program, which asked us to **"Wake the Sherlock within us."** The task stated us that an online shopping account of a friend seems to be compromised. We are provided with a text file which has all the login details of the particular account, including the machine used to login and the IP address of the machine. Our task is to go through the text file, which possibly contains thousands of lines of details, and figure out the following:  

* How many unique IPs were used to login the particular account. This could help us figure out whether or not our friend is under a scam.  
* How many times was the account logged in using an "iPad". This is just for quality purpose. ;)  

This task could be very well executed using MS Excel or some online tool, but working it out using python was fun.
